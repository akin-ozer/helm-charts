# Helm installation

You can install this chart using directly this Helm repository:

```

{{ template "chart.sourcesSection" . }}

## Values managed globally

This chart implements the [New Relic's common Helm library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/library/common-library) which
means that it honors a wide range of defaults and globals common to most New Relic Helm charts.

Options that can be defined globally include `affinity`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `proxy` and others. The full list can be found at
[user's guide of the common library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/library/common-library/README.md).

## Chart particularities

> **TODO:** Here is where you should add particularities for this chart like what does the chart do with the privileged and
low data modes or any other quirk that it could have.

### TODOs
There are values that should be planned at some point of removed from the `values.yaml`. I leave them here documented
as TODO:
 * `licenseKey`: comes from the common library but it would not be needed as it is an ingestion API Key, not a REST one.
 * `rbac`: the is a placeholder for RBAC that simply list pods. this has to be narrowed to the use case of this agent.
 * `customAttributes`: decorate everything with this custom attributes, maybe as they come from opamp.
 * `proxy`, `nrStaging` and `fedramp` support on the meta agent. This could be made from the chart itself changing the opamp endpoint.
 * `verboseLog`: legacy toggle to enable verbosity.

Other TODOs:
 * Add probes for liveness and readiness.
